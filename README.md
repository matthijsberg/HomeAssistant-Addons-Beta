# HomeAssistant-Addons BETA
My take at building some HA addons that I miss. BETA FOR DEV EN TEST

Add this URL into HA as a custom repository: https://github.com/matthijsberg/HomeAssistant-Addons-Beta/

## Roon Server
Based on the work of Steef; https://github.com/steefdebruijn/docker-roonserver

Roon server will be installed during container start since i'm officially not allowed to distribute the software. So a add-on rebuild will upgrade. Perhaps talk to Roon folks one day. 

The Add-on maps /backup and /media into the container to use.
